If you would like to play along see the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com).

The Event
---------
Each day a challenge will be given.  In a branch corresponding to the year I will post my solution to the challenge 
I'll create a new directory each day: `day01`, `day02` etc. Each directory will contain the prompt, the solution code, the provided input, and my answer.
